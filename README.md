# D4PVP

A couple of methods have recently been published aiming to provide metrics or predictions to determine the pathogenicity of genomic mutations. This repository contains documentation of the available datasets from these published methods and scripts to help obtain the data and code (if available) to recreate the previous analyses.

### Previously published methods and datasets
  * [ClinVar-ESP CADD version1 features](https://github.com/ryanabo/D4PVP/blob/master/datasets/clinvar_esp_caddv1/README.md) - CADD and DANN ClinVar-ESP dataset with 61406 variants (29315 pathogenic and 32091 benign variants) and 90 features (949 expanded)
  * [CADD training and testing data](https://github.com/ryanabo/D4PVP/blob/master/datasets/cadd/README.md) - CADD version 1.3 training and testing dataset. The testing contains 35M variants (17521530 pathogenic and 17521530 benign variants) and 102 features (1063 expanded). The testing set contains 350051 variants (174800 pathogenic and 175251 benign) and 102 features (1063 expanded). 
  * [DANN training, testing and validation data](https://github.com/ryanabo/D4PVP/blob/master/datasets/dann/README.md) - DANN publication datasets (same as CADD).
  * [SSCM training, testing and validation data](https://github.com/ryanabo/D4PVP/blob/master/datasets/sscm/README.md) - SSCM publication dataset.
